This Simple Inventory Management System Project is only accessible to the shop administrator. It requires the administrator system user credential to gain access to the features and functionalities. The Administrator can manage the list of Customers, Categories, Brands, Suppliers, Products, Purchases, and Orders. Each of these features contains CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations or functionalities. The system automatically computes the available stock of each product on hand.

The project lists were developed using PHP and MySQL Database. Each List on this application is displayed using the Bootstrap DataTables. Data are being loaded using Ajax Requests. Each of the delete functions has a confirmation feature that prevents the user to remove the data by accident. The application forms for each process are displayed using the Bootstrap Modal.
